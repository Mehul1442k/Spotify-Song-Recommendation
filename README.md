# Spotify-Song-Recommendation

Implemented a song lyrics vectorization process using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and applied cosine similarity between songs based on their TF-IDF vectors. This approach facilitated the calculation of the minimum distance between vectors to provide recommendations. Successfully deployed an end-to-end project integrating the Spotify API to enhance the user experience.
